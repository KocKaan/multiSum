Rules: use only the C++ standard library.

1. Write a function int sum(const std::vector<int>& arr) that sums an array of ints in a single thread and returns the sum as an int.  Save your source as single.cpp.


2. Multi thread it without using any synchronization primitives.  Use exactly 4 threads and assume the arrayâ€™s size is a multiple of 4.  Describe all possible race conditions and their effects in as much detail as possible.  Save your source as naive.cpp and notes as notes.md.


3. Solve the race conditions in such a way that the performance is bad.  Save your source as slow.cpp.  Describe your solution in notes.md.

4. Solve the race conditions in such a way that the performance is good.  Save your source as fast.cpp.  Describe your solution in notes.md.
Describe other potential solutions for slow.cpp and fast.cpp and compare and contrast them.
